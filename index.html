                <h2>Happy 61st Birthday, Fiona!</h2>
                <p>Dear Fiona,</p>
                <p>First of all, congratulations on your 61st birthday! 
                    This website has been created to help plan an amazing 
                    and unforgettable day out in Glasgow, tailored to your preferences. 
                    Let's make sure it's a day full of enjoyment, delicious food, 
                    and fantastic experiences!</p>
                <p><strong>Public Transportation:</strong> Using public transport gives us the flexibility to 
                    relax and enjoy the day, including having drinks at lunch or tea.</p>
                <p><strong>Kennel Care:</strong> The departure and return times are well within the 
                    opening hours of the kennels, and our staff will take care of everything, 
                    including Magnus. The day, <strong>October 9th</strong>, 
                    will be relatively quiet with 20 kennels occupied, 4 arrivals, and 3 departures. 
                    We'll have extra staff on hand, just like we did for my birthday earlier this year.</p>
                <p id="summary-paragraph">Based on your choices so far, we haven't planned any specific activities yet. As you make selections below, this summary will update to reflect your choices for the day.</p>
