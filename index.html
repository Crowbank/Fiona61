            <p>Dear Fiona,</p>
            <p>First of all, congratulations on your 61st birthday! This website has been created with a single purpose: to help plan an amazing and unforgettable day out in Glasgow, tailored to your preferences. Let's make sure it’s a day full of enjoyment, delicious food, and fantastic experiences!</p>

            <h2>Logistics and Details</h2>
            <p>We'll be departing from Cumbernauld, using public transportation to make sure both of us can relax and enjoy the day, including a drink or two! Departure and return times will be well within the opening hours of the kennels, so the staff will be taking care of everything — including our beloved Magnus.</p>
            <p>October 9th is a Wednesday, and it’s expected to be relatively quiet at the kennels. We will have 18 kennels occupied, with just 4 arrivals and 3 departures. Rest assured, we've arranged for extra staffing, just like we did for my birthday earlier this year, so you won’t have to worry about a thing!</p>
